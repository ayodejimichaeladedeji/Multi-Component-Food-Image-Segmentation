Evaluation of the performance of a Fine-tuned PointRend-enhanced Mask R-CNN architecture for the development of an instance
segmentation model to segment and detect food components from images with multiple food components.

The Detectron2 framework was utilised for the purpose of this evaluation, in conjunction with the FoodSeg103 and UECFoodPixComplete datasets.
